# ResturantSampleApp

I have used Google API to get near by locations, using lat and long. To achive it API key from google is requred and it is all done into the application.

I have used Almofire t work with the API.

I have used Google map to show the root of the destination. I have shown the direction within the app, even through Google Map app(External), this could be done by navigating to it directly.

I have used MVC architucture, Protocol oriented programing  in tha application.(I have experience on MVVM as well)
